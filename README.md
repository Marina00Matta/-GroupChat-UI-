# -GroupChat-UI-
Client/Server group chat application implemented with Java 

to run these files.
you should download first the client.java/ server.java files.
first you should compile "Server.java" file on a terminal if you are on ubuntu or cmd if you are a windows user by this command "javac Server.java"
and then run the same file by using this command "Server.java"
then compile "Client.java" and run it by this comman "java Client" on TWO different terminals.
it will ask for a username ex: enter user 1/ user 2
now you have three terminal one for the server and two for the clients. 
you can chit chat now, and you can open many windows..
voilaa..
